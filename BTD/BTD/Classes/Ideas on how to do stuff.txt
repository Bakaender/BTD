Redo how I'm passing the towers projectile texture. Maybe add it to the towers graphic. 

in checkfire I should be able to pass in game time and add to a new variable (time since last shot) and if that is >= shot speed only shoot then.
	Make sure I do time increase only once per update, not once per enemy checked.

Not really sure how to do rotation on projectiles based on enemy position in relation yet. Possibly slope along with if a and b are - or +.

Need to add in hitting the target, lowering health, etc.

General Stuff:
Move variables like scaling, lifes, lumber, gold to a public static class outside of game1 so I can access them in classes such as enemy to take away a life.


Eventually want to change texture dimensions to 64 for when I make my own graphics.
